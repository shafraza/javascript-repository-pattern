# javascript-repository-pattern

This code snippet implements a user repository using the repository pattern. The repository pattern is a design pattern that separates the code that retrieves data from the code that uses the data. It provides a layer of abstraction between the database and the application code, making it easier to write unit tests and change the underlying data storage without affecting the application code.

The <code>UserRepository</code>  class defines methods for retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting user objects. The class takes a database object as a constructor parameter, which it uses to interact with the database.
The <code>getById</code>  method retrieves a user object by its ID. It uses a parameterized SQL query to prevent SQL injection attacks and returns the first row of the result set.
The <code>getAll</code>  method retrieves all user objects from the database and returns the result set.

The <code>create</code>  method inserts a new user object into the database and returns the ID of the newly inserted row.

The <code>update</code>  method updates an existing user object in the database and returns a boolean value indicating whether the update was successful.

The <code>delete</code> method deletes an existing user object from the database and returns a boolean value indicating whether the delete was successful.

Overall, the repository pattern provides a clean and maintainable way to interact with a database in a JavaScript application.
